        <p>Dino Storm Is a game all about a cowboy/cowgirl that got lost in a desert and had no where else to go, so they made themselves at home at Dinoville, you start off with a "Cleo" which is a Dinosaur that is related to the Raptor, The king of all dinosaurs as you see in the image is the Tyrannosaurus Rex, Its extreemly difficult to get that dinosaur out of all. It requires you to be a sheriff which is hard!
        You join clans that take over lands and keeps that give you fame, which you need to get to be a sheriff, then get the rex. The game is complex, so I wont go into depth but I would recommend the game if you like adventure and war!</p>
